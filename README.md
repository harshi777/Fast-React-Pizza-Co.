 # Fast React Pizza Co.

Welcome to **Fast React Pizza Co.**! üçï This is my first project built with React, where I created a pizza ordering app that showcases different pizzas along with their ingredients, quantities, and prices.

## Project Overview

In this project, users can browse through various pizzas, see their details, and understand what makes each pizza unique. My main goals were to learn and implement core React concepts, and I'm excited to share what I've achieved!

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with several important React features:

- **Component Reusability**: I learned how to create reusable components to keep my code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- **Props and Destructuring**: I implemented props to pass data to components, utilizing destructuring for cleaner code.
- **Conditional Rendering**: I practiced rendering components conditionally based on user interactions and state changes.
- **React Fragments**: I discovered how to use React fragments to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
- **Rendering Lists**: I learned how to dynamically render lists of items, which is essential for displaying the available pizzas.
